# California Wine Cooperative

## About

In 2019, students in a Web Development Bootcamp — Matthew Heimark, Avid Wine Appreciator, after years of living in the the northern Bay Area; Madeleine Kemeny, a former Pastry Chef and General Snob with a parent living in the Russian River Valley and across the road from multiple vineyards; Marta Tomaras, an Experienced Wine Fan, who grew up with grandparents making their own wine; and Jenine Ellis — developed a concept for their third student group project to introduce lesser known and smaller batch producing vineyards to discerning wine consumers whose local shops, outside of California, might not represent these wonderful products.

This site includes a full e-commerce experience of browsing or searching products, selecting items for purchase, finding more details about the producer, adding items to cart, and an admin portal which displays helpful information from the business owner side.
