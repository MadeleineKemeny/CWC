## About

In 2019, students in a Web Development Bootcamp — Matthew Heimark, Avid Wine Appreciator, after years of living in the the northern Bay Area; Madeleine Kemeny, a former Pastry Chef and General Snob with a parent living in the Russian River Valley and across the road from multiple vineyards; Marta Tomaras, an Experienced Wine Fan, who grew up with grandparents making their own wine; and Jenine Ellis (who actually prefers KoolAid) — developed a concept for their third student group project to introduce lesser known and smaller batch producing vineyards to discerning wine consumers whose local shops, outside of California, might not represent these wonderful products.

Because they were students, not wine merchants, they filled a database by scraping information from Wine.com on California brands. Maybe someday one of them will grow up, and get that business rolling: get the license, create the relationahipa with the interesting wine producers, acquire the storage and shipping facilities, launch a working e-commerce site, and retire in northern California amongst the beautiful scenery and great wine. In the meantime, we present to you a working version of that vision. And based on the analytics, there are people on multiple continents wanting it to happen!



This site includes a full e-commerce experience of browsing or searching products, selecting items for purchase, finding more details about the producer, adding items to cart, and an admin portal which displays helpful information from the business owner side.
